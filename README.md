# Hi there! I'm Eli Slaughter 

I'm a frontend web developer located in Kingston, Ontario. I've completed many React-based frontend projects on my own time and am always looking to expand my skillset. I work meticulously to produce clean-looking websites that still have all the expected functionality for a smooth user experience. As well as keeping the project visually modern, I have been honing my software engineering skills to ensure that my code is robust, modular, and extensible. 

## My work experience

At my last company, Wrk, I grew considerably as a developer over the 2+ years working there. While my specialization was still in frontend, I was frequently required to be flexible enough to work in areas of development I had limited experience in. Despite the challenge, I was very successful in completing my work and learned plenty of new skills along the way. Skills such as SQL database management and Luigi tasks, Python APIs/Views, and how to perform devops tasks in Kubernetes/GCP. I was also given projects with large amounts of responsibility placed on myself that were delivered successfully and greatly improved the experience for our userbase. 

## My work

My currently featured portfolio is centered around websites and web apps from when I was teaching myself web development. My featured respositories are some of my personal favorites in terms of combining user interface and user-friendly functionality. A more detailed look at my featured work can be found on my personal website. My framework of choice is React, and I have experience in using git version control, npm, cygwin, as well as more specialized tools like Postman for API testing. I have a bit of web configuration experience, and learned how to deploy a website independently including handling the domain registration and DNS setup. 

## What I'm working on

Now that I've established a solid foundation for my frontend skills, I've been branching out into more advanced concepts of web development. I've been teaching myself design principles and strategies to produce cleaner project code. I've been practicing how to design components and archtecture for re-usability and readability, and have been learning how to write more comprehensive tests with Jest to further ensure that my code is stable and robust.

## Open for Opportunities

If you've had a look at my profile and like my work, I'm available for hire. Although I market myself as a Frontend developer, I am open to other positions that require a similar skillset. I'm a fast learner, and I can adapt to keep up with whatever technologies are thrown at me. I'm open to hear what projects or teams you need an extra hand on, and am eager to have the opportunity to put my skills to the test. I am currently open for remote work opportunties at this time.

## My Interests

Outside of programming and development, I spend a lot of time working on my own creative writing. I always used to get lost in books as a kid and I never grew out of it. I have just started reading the Malazan series of novels. 

I also love to cook and bake! My favourite savory dish to make is a classic chicken pot pie, and my favorite dessert is a nice fudgy brownie. I recently came into possession of Claire Saffitz's "Dessert Person" book and I've been enjoying the recipes I've made so far from it.
