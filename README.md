# Hi there! I'm Eli Slaughter 

I'm a frontend web developer located in Waterloo, Ontario. I'm self taught and have been developing a number of projects to hone my skills. I work diligently to produce clean-looking websites that still have all the expected functionality for a smooth user experience. As well as keeping the project visually modern, I have been developing my software engineering skills to ensure that my code is robust, re-useable, and easily readable. 

## My work

My currently featured portfolio is centered around websites and web apps. My featured respositories are some of my personal favorites in terms of combining user interface and user-friendly functionality. A more detailed look at my featured work can be found on my personal website. My framework of choice is React, and I have experience in using git version control, npm, cygwin, as well as more specialized tools like Postman for API testing. I have a bit of experience in backend development with heroku deployments, and learned how to deploy a website independently including handling the domain registration and DNS setup. 

## What I'm working on

Now that I've established a solid foundation for my HTML/CSS/JS skills, I've been branching out into more advanced concepts of web development. I've been teaching myself data structures and algorithms, as well as design principles and strategies to produce cleaner project code. I've been making the move from Javascript to Typescript, and have been learning how to write tests with Jest to further ensure that my code is stable and robust. I recently received a Raspberry Pi as a gift, and have been using it to learn how to use UNIX.

Aside from my own learning, I have been working on some more projects to fully round-out my portfolio. My latest project is to port my [pomodoro app](https://ens-pomodoro-app.vercel.app/) to an electron app, so that I can use it with my Raspberry Pi's touch screen.

## Open for Opportunities

If you've had a look at my profile and like my work, I'm available for hire. Although I market myself as a Frontend developer, I am open to other positions that require a similar skillset. I'm a fast learner, and I can adapt to keep up with whatever technologies are thrown at me. I'm open to hear what projects or teams you need an extra hand on, and am eager to have the opportunity to put my skills to the test. I am currently open for remote work opportunties at this time.

## My Interests

Outside of programming and development, I spend a lot of time working on my own creative writing. I always used to get lost in books as a kid and I never grew out of it. I have just started reading the Malazan series of novels. 

I also love to cook and bake! My favourite savory dish to make is a classic chicken pot pie, and my favorite dessert are some nice fudgy brownies. I recently came into possession of Claire Saffitz's "Dessert Person" book and I've been enjoying the recipes I've made so far from it.
